reset their password, or recover a forgotten password.The following images are my designs of the most typical
authentication forms for a website or application:**

### In conclusion:

Authentication forms are a crucial design component of any website or application that requires user authentication.
They help ensure the security and privacy of users' accounts and personal information.
This design offers a simple and effective way for the user to navigate through the authetication scope.
The password and repeat password fields include a toggle eye icon  that allows the user to show or hide their password
when they are typing it. The form also includes a checkbox for the user to agree to the terms and conditions.
Finally, each form has its own corresponding button and a unique prompt for the user. The code includes a reference to
a JavaScript file called `passwordVisibility.js`, that controls the functionality of the password toggle icons.
Finally, the code references a CSS stylesheet called `style.css`for custom styling and the Font Awesome icon library.
